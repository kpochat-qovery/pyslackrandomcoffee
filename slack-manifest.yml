  description: Randomly pairs channel members for coffee chats
  long_description: |-
    A bot that randomly matches members of a Slack channel for coffee dates.

    The bot automatically:
    - Pairs all members in a channel randomly
    - Avoids repeating recent matches by looking back at history
    - Sends group DMs to each pair
    - Handles odd number of members by pairing one person twice

    Perfect for building connections in remote teams, new hire onboarding,
    or fostering cross-team collaboration.
